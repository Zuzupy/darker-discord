# Darker Discord
Enables and modifies the hidden midnight theme in Discord


### Installation
Step 1. Install Tampermonkey
> You need to install an add-on called Tampermonkey in your browser. This can be done by going to [tampermonkey.net](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and following its instructions.

Step 2. Developer Mode
> This part seems scary, so read the source code if you feel uneasy!  
> You need to type `chrome://extensions` in the search bar, or by going to â‹® > Extensions > Manage Extensions. There, you should find a switch titled "Developer mode". Make sure it's enabled.

Step 3. Download The Script
> Download the [darker-discord.user.js](/darker-discord.user.js) file and navigate to it in your file manager. I trust that you'll be able to find it. c:

Step 4. Tampermonkey Dashboard
> Now you need to open your Tampermonkey dashboard. You can do this by clicking its extension icon and selecting "Dashboard".
> The icon should be near the top right corner, and you might have to click a pizzle-piece-looking thing to find it.

Step 5. Installing Darker-Discord
> Finally! Assuming you still have your file manager opened, grab the `darker-discord.user.js` file and drag it over the Tampermonkey dashboard. This will bring about a lot of scary CSS/JS code (scary). All you need to know is that the "Install" button is your friend and will make it disappear.  
> Congratulations! **DON'T FORGET TO REFRESH DISCORD...**
